SHOW DATABASES;

/* 2. Create a new database and a new table as follows:
		a. The name of the new database should be 'for_practice_db'.
		b. The table should be named 'study_performance'. The column's names and data type should be:

/* 3. Using MySQL Workbench:
		a. Import the data from the Comma-Separated Value file named 'study_performance.csv'.
		b. The data from that file needs to be added to the table 'study_performace' (that was 
        previously created) under the database 'for_practice_db'.
		c. Demonstrate these procedures with pictures.
*/
-- For the answer of question 3, see the pdf presentation.

/* 4. Create a View, which is essentially a virtual table generated based on a specified query, distinct 
from a Temporary Table:
		a.Create a view named 'test_results' containing the scores for math, reading, and writing, along 
        with the Study Performance ID. 
		b. Afterwards, provide visual representations, including screenshots of the view's schema and the 
        first five rows of data.

/* 5. Create two new users for the 'for_practice_db' database:
		a. Both of these users should only have access to the database named 'for_practice_db'.
		b. The firs user's name is Marie Hayes and should have all privileges to that database. Use the 
        default password of 'Welcome01'.
		c. The second user's name is Oscar Castro. He should only have the privileges of viewing the 
        tables and 'views' and to do queries. Use the same default passwords for this user too.
		d. Force the users to change their password upon login.

/* 7. Create a backup of the 'for_practice_db' database as follows:
		a. All tables, including Views, will need to be part of the backup.
		b. Export it as a Self-Contained file with the file extension sql.
		c. Include Create Schema and the some must be in a single transaction.
		d. Lastly, delete the 'for_practice_db' database from MySQL.
